# Implementation Notes

## Environment

If you want to just preview the application without bothering with the setup, you can use the following link:

## Start the application

1. Make sure to follow `.env.example` and create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
   pnpm i
````

3. Init the database and seed it with initial data:

   ```bash
   pnpm db:init && pnpm db:seed
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Testing

### Unit tests

I implemented unit tests for the core functionality of the application, or what I thought was critical enough to be tested.
You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Database

### Database Schema

The database schema can be found in `src/db/schema.sql`. It's a raw SQL file that defines the structure of the database.

### Scripts

For this project I decided to use my own scripts as mechanism for database initialization and seeding. The scripts are located in the `scripts` directory, that utilize SQL scripts from `src/db` directory.

## Assumptions & Implementation notes

1. The project structure follows a domain-driven design approach, with clear separation of concerns. Even though this is a super small project, I wanted to showcase how I would structure a larger application.
2. For the grades page, I assumed that I just need to handle insertions only, but added a simple list of all the grades in the database, since it made more sense to have it.
3. For reading the numbers from the database, I used the window function `LEAD` which is supported by PostgreSQL. This allows us to get the next value in the sequence without having to do a self-join.
   To optimize reading the numbers, I also created an index on the `value` column of the `numbers` table. This allows for faster lookups when reading the numbers.

   * Further optimizations could be made by implementing server-side pagination, but for the sake of simplicity I decided to keep it as is.
     Also, MUI DataGrid supports sorting and filtering out of the box on the client side, which is kinda nice, so implementing server-side filtering and sorting on top of server-side pagination would be a bit overkill for this project.
4. For data fetching I used the REST API approach, so I'm mostly relying on client-side state management. I used React Query to handle the data fetching and caching, which is a great library for this purpose.
   Also note the `DataService` module â€” this approach makes it very easy to manage query keys and functions in one place. Also, makes it very easy to unit test each module separately.
5. I used MUI for the UI components as per the requirements. I've also used MUI in the past, so I felt comfortable using it for this project.
6. For handling forms and validation, I used React Hook Form along with Zod. This makes it easier to control form inputs and check if the values are valid.
   In the `form-fields` folder, I made some custom components that wrap MUI components. These are set up to work smoothly with React Hook Form and help keep the code clean.
